#Time Scrapper 

This application is make to help with learning how to get information off of other websites and to then use that information on you page. The app is grabbing news articles from the a local news site, ksl, and then taking the articles to placing for the user to see. The user can then save what article they want to come back to and read at another time. The project was set up to work with MongoDB on the back end. Currently the application is still under construction and will need to have a couple of things add to be a working product.
